This file is the "README" for the refactored build of the XPC "suite".

This build of XPC is a near clone of the original XPC.  We
want to use a recursive make process, and also support building on Windows
with mingw.  We wanted to use bjam, but that product had bugs in its Doxygen
support and it was too difficult to provide our own Doxygen support.  So we
went back to good old GNU Autotools.  We also want to clean out the cruft
and structure the projects, documentation, man pages, internationalization,
and pkgconfig information in a more unified way.  We also split XPC into
(so far) XPC Basic and XPC Comm.

The documentation is provided almost exclusively in Doxygen format in
directories named "doc/dox".  One can read them directly in a text editor,
or build HTML and PDF files using the following commands:

   $ ./bootstrap
   $ ./build docs

The PDF file will be found in the xpc_basic/release/doc/dox directory.

This is the best way to understand the layout of the XPC projects.

If you just want to have the libraries and test applications built and
tested, then run the following command
(which also accepts an '--enable-debug' option):

   $ ./scripts/build --test

Otherwise, run the following command to start to learn more:

   $ ./bootstrap --help

You will probably want to install the bootstrap scripts system-wide using
the --boot-install option.

Packages that must be installed (exact names may vary on your system) in
order to build this project:

   automake, autoconf, autopoint, autotools-dev, and autoconf-archive
   gcc, g++, libtool
   doxygen
   gettext
   graphviz
   texlive, texlive-latex-base
   tofrodos
