"README" for the XPC Hello application (xpchello).

This project provides a small application to demonstrate the many facets
(pun intended) of internationalizing an application within the context of
GNU automake.  The application doesn't do much, and we provide only a bad
Internet-lookup translation in Spanish.

As an added 'hello', to show how to link to other XPC libraries, this project
also provides a test application to verify that it can be linked to the XPC
C unit-test library when that library is installed in the conventional GNU
manner.  The C unit-test library package is called "xpccut-1.0".  The
'hello' test program also illustrates installing and linking to a library
that is supported by the GNU "pkgconfig" system.  It doesn't really do much
in the way of testing, though.

For detailed information on the XPC 'hello' project, see the Doxygen
documentation generated from the files in the doc/dox sub-directory.  To
generate this documentation, first install the "doxygen" and "graphviz"
projects.  (Also install "texlive" if you want to generate the PDF form of
the documentation.)  Then issue the following commands:

   $  cd doc/dox
   $  doxygen doxygen.cfg

You can then browse the project documentation by load the link at

   doc/dox/html/index.html

If you want PDF documentation (in a single file), additionally do the
following commands; you'll find 'refman.pdf' generated in the 'latex'
directory.

   $  cd latex
   $  make refman.pdf

To build the 'hello' project from scratch, first run this command:

   $  ./bootstrap --super-boot

If you had installed the XPC unit-test library, you can then do a "make"
from the current directory.

If not, then you have to "make" the src and dox subdirectories manually.
The tests directory cannot be built without the XPC C Unit Test library
installed.

Finally, you can do "./bootstrap --help" for more information.

Windows:

   Sorry, at this time, this project does not support Windows, mostly due
   to gettext.  I don't have a lot of motivation to get gettext() working
   under Windows.  If you get it to work, please send me the files or
   changes you needed.

   This project might build under Cygwin, but I'm not sure if all of the
   components needed (e.g. graphviz and autopoint) are available with
   Cygwin/X.  Again, I will be happy to receive any fixes.
