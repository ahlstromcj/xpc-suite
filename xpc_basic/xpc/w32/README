==============================
3rd-PARTY LIBRARY INSTALLATION
==============================

This project implements its functions using the POSIX threads (pthreads)
API.  Therefore, it requires the developer to install the pthreads-w32
project.  The easiest way is to download and run this executable:

   ftp://sourceware.org/pub/pthreads-win32/pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release.exe

(That is the latest version, dated 12/22/2006.)

Run the executable and extract it to its final destination (extraction is
installation for this product):

   1. Create that new folder C:\Program Files\pthreads before running
      the executable.
   2. Extract it to C:\Program Files\pthreads, using the "Browse" button 
      followed by the "Extract" button.  Then click the "Done" button.
   3. Verify the existence of C:\Program Files\pthread and its subdirectories
      "Pre-built.2", "pthreads.2", and "QueueUserAPCEx".

Create a system or user variable for this directory, tacking on a little
more, so that the "include" and "libs" directories are next:

   PTHREADS_W32 = C:\Program Files\pthreads\Pre-built.2

The project files for Win32 then include these entries:

   $(PTHREADS_W32)/include
   $(PTHREADS_W32)/lib
   pthreadVCE2.lib

IMPORTANT:

   After you have defined this environment variable, you should stop
   all instances of Windows Explorer, Visual Studio, and the DOS console.
   Otherwise, they and their child processes will not see the new
   environment variable!

   If you keep having problems building libxpc.lib, then make sure that
   PTHREADS_W32 is properly defined, and reboot.

Note that there is also a Win32 driver provided by pthreads-w32.  This
driver provides pre-emptive APC by forcing threads into an alertable state
when the APC is queued, thus allowing true async cancellation of threads
(including blocked threads).  See that project's README file for more
information.

==============================
Visual Studio Warnings
==============================

These warnings are disabled due to problems in the VS 7.0 Windows header files:

   C4127    Use of constant in while()
   C4201    Nonstandard extension used: nameless struct/union
