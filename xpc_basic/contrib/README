"README" for the XPC 'contrib' directory

The contrib directory contains scripts and other items from other sources,
or odds and ends that could be useful to someone.  Some of the items in this
directory are copied by scripts to XPC projects to set them up fully.

The contrib directory also contains configuration files that may be of
interest to other users using vim, bash, emacs, mrxvt, splint, taskjuggler,
and more.

Many of these files need to be renamed when installed.   For example,
"input.rc" is copied to "/etc/inputrc", and "mrxvt.rc" is copied to
"~/.mrxvtrc".

   DIR_COLORS              Our DIR_COLORS file for added colors and file types.
   bash.rc                 A simple sample .bashrc file.
   c.vim                   Additional vim C syntax highlighting.
   ChangeLog               A sample ChangeLog file for when xpc uses one.
   cgbd.rc                 A sample configuration file for cgdb.
   configure-os-arch.ac    A sample cross-compilation configure.ac file.  A
                           very complex example handling many operating systems.
   cpp.vim                 Additional vim C++ syntax highlighting.
   emacs.rc                .emacs configuration file (for debugging in v. 22)
   evolution.txt           Developer humor.
   example_po.txt          Sample internationalization file.
   fluxbox-keys.rc         ~/.fluxbox/keys mappings you fluxboxers might like.
   gemdb                   A script to run emacs v. 22 in GUD mode; requires 
                           that emacs.rc be incorporated into ~/.emacs
   gpl-code-insert.txt     GPL license formatted for inclusion in code.
   indent.pro              An 'indent' profile to enforce conventions (TODO).
   input.rc                Our version of inputrc, with tabs, no beeps.
   mkinstalldirs*          A couple of versions of a mkdir replacement.
   mrxvt.rc                Our configuration file for the "multi-rxvt" terminal.
   print_bw.vim            Sets colors for printing.
   splint.rc               Configuration for the splint C code analyzer.

   tjp.vim                 Syntax coloring for TaskJuggler project files.
   vim-regexps.txt         Some tricky regular expressions.
   vim.rc                  Our ~/.vimrc file.
   ogg.m4                  One way to do a lib-detection macro.
   ost_socket.m4           Sample socket-library detection mechanism.
   ost_win32.m4            Sample Windows detection mechanism.
   xpc.m4                  The XPC way to do a lib-detection macro.
   zlib.m4                 Another way to do a lib-detection macro.

   Note that xpc.m4 is the only m4 file from the contrib directory that
   gets installed.

mkinstalldirs-1.1
mkinstalldirs-1.9
mkinstalldirs-1.10

   We kept getting an error for "make install" for the po directory.  We
   were surprised to find that, although the automake command creates a
   number of files that it needs, mkinstalldirs is not one of them.  So a
   couple of versions (one fairly old, one fairly new) are provided.  The
   bootstrap script copies mkinstalldirs-1.9 to autoconf/mkinstalldirs, and
   this lets the po makefile do its work.  Obviously, this might not be the
   best way to obtain mkinstalldirs.  Let us know if you find something
   better.  For more information, do "info automake" and search for
   "mkinstalldirs".

xpc.m4

   Copy this macro to the "macros" or "m4" directory of your project.  Or
   append it to your aclocal.m4 file.  The "make install" command copies it
   to /usr/local/share/aclocal/ by default.

*xorg.conf

   We supply some sample xorg.conf files in the 'xorg' directory.  Why not?
