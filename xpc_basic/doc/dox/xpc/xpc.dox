\page       xpc_utility_introduction XPC C Utility Library

This file describes the <b>XPC C</b> utility library, which is considered
the basic library in the <b>XPC</b> suite.

\section xpc_utility_introduction Introduction to the C Unit-Test Library

The <b>XPC</b> library is a "cross-programming C" utility library that provides
some very basic functionality that just about any application might need.
This library is the main (and most basic) library in the <b>XPC</b> library
suite.

The <b>XPC C</b> library (libxpc) is a <b>C</b> library that provides
functionality useful in most projects.

   -  CPU and operating system identification
   -  Error and message logging
   -  GNU gettext support
   -  Numeric support
   -  Some minor command-line options handling
   -  Basic INI-file parsing
   -  Support for using pthreads.
   -  Other portability functions.

<b>MORE TO COME</b>

Although the utility <b>XPC</b> library is written and somewhat tested,
it is a work in progress and we have not yet had time to describe it at
a higher level.
